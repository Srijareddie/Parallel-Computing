# Parallel Square Root Calculation

This program demonstrates a parallel-like approach to calculate square roots for an array of random numbers using C++.

## Overview

The program initializes an array of random float numbers and calculates their square roots concurrently (simulated using a loop). It then prints a formatted list showing each original number and its corresponding square root.

## Code Explanation

- **Initialization**: Generates `n` random float numbers between 0 and 999.
- **Parallel-like Calculation**: Hypothetically uses a loop to compute square roots concurrently for each number.
- **Output**: Displays a formatted list showing each original number and its square root.

## How to Run

To compile and run the program locally:
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++, Visual Studio).
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the source code.
4. Compile the code using your preferred C++ compiler.
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o sqrt_program
